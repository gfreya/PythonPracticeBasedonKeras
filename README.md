# PythonPracticeBasedonKeras
It includes very practical application of python with deep learning framework Keras. It includes use some simple models like regression model to predict something like Boston house price. It also includes some more complex models like CNN and LSTM to solve more complicated problems in our daily life.
It also includes some ways to save the created models including the important weights in the model so that the created model can be used at once on other similar problems.
